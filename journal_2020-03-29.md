# Things I Learned This Week (March 23-27, 2020)

This week, I:

- Re-taught myself how to push journal files in the face of the Coronavirus Pandemic
- Learned that reflecting on historical documents (including literature like *Walden*) is important when dealing with modern-day history-making situations
- Used version tracking tools to compare Thoreau's text, the Gettysburg Address, and an Emily Dickinson poem
- Was able to make connections between the "fluid text" I am encountering in this class, with the fluid text of W. B. Yeats that I learned about in a previous class ("Editing Yeats" with Professor Doggett)
- Realized that writers often feel the necessity to revise their works even after publication, in order to more accurately articulate their past experiences, and/or articulate how their opinions have changed over time with new gained knowledge or life experience
