## Things I Learned Today

### Markdown

I learned a lot today! Some of these things include:

- Typing "cd" on Git Bash to launch a computing command ("cd" or "~" alone can also bring me back to my default home location)

- Typing "pwd" on Git Bash in order to figure out my current location in the system
