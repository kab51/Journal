## End of Semester Reflection:

# A Year to Remember!

Back in March, "coronavirus" was a word at the back of most Americans' minds. It was something happening to other countries, to other people. That is, until we caught word of Gov. Cuomo's announcement that college classes were cancelled for the rest of the semester. We hurriedly packed up and headed home. I passed a flashing sign on the thruway: *"Save Lives! Stay Home!"* The U.S. soon went into lockdown, and we into self-isolated quarantine. I'll be the first to admit, with everything seeming so urgent, I had serious doubts about how continuing this Digital Lit class--and especially the final group project--would work out. Suddenly, for the first time since I've been a college student, schoolwork just didn't seem like a priority. 

Luckily, I am happy to say my doubts were proved wrong. Our group project went way smoother than expected, thanks to communication via Slack, and clear instruction on how to use GitHub, create timelines, and encode TEI files. With help from professors, teaching assistants, classmates, and teammates, our group was able to complete a finished product that I am all the more proud of given the circumstances. 

This class has taught me a lot; not just coding basics and digital collaboration methods, but more abstract things, too. Optimism and determination in the face of challenges, teamwork, resourcefulness, empathy, compassion, and a new appreciation for all things *Walden*. This course is such a unique blend of simplicity and complexity, of primitive and technologically advanced concepts: I mean, we had to take a handwritten 19th century text and digitizing it through a project that had to be done 100% online from the comfort of our own homes, miles apart from our teammembers! 

In a way, taking this course on digitizing *Walden* this semester was extremely fitting. Being isolated at home and figuring out innovative ways of connecting with our friends and environment was in its own way, like a field-trip or empathy-driven project of what it'd be like to live like Thoreau. I've found myself taking walks in the woods a lot more often, appreciating the little things in life. I take time to breathe, reflect, and reach out to people in my life. My cousin, who lives in another state, even sent me a handwritten letter to revive our childhood pen pal days after a 14-year hiatus! Through these experiences, I've been able to relate to Thoreau's insights in *Walden* on a whole new level. His writing reads like a guide on how to cope healthily in self-isolation. I feel like I've gained new perspectives on life, which is what literature and the humanities are all about!
