## Things I've Learned During This Course:

        In writing blog post #2, I was found myself reflecting on, not only what I've learned during this class, but what I've learned throughout my entire time as an English major at SUNY Geneseo. These past three years have absolutely flown by, which says something about how rapidly my views on English and the Humanities have changed in such a short period. In fact, as a freshman, I didn't even know what "the Humanities" meant at all.
        Before coming to college, I had never been exposed to famous authors' drafts. As a high schooler, I thought a rough draft was just some technique teachers forced their students to do to somehow become better writers. It never occurred to me that the best writers in history intentionally completed multiple drafts before publishing their work. And it certainly never occurred to me that such drafts would be worth studying and learning from. 
        Yet, here I am. This Digital Literature course has taught me that a lot can be learned from the decisions a writer makes during the writing/editing process, and that such decisions are oftentimes only documented and able to be studied through the preserved drafts, like that of Thoreau's Walden. Writing is the art of conveying one's message as accurately as possible. By studying the words that a writer swaps in for others, digital humanists can gain insight and make claims about the author's intention. We can also form new theories and interpretations about a text through studying fluid text and metareading.
        In a broader, perhaps more philosophical sense, these things that I've learned have made me realize the importance of error and change. Even the best of writers feel the need to change their opinions/views/perspectives, and in turn, their writing. As a society, we are afraid of mistakes, errors, failure, being wrong, and argument--even when arguments are constructive debates. In stark contrast, reading Thoreau has made me appreciate that learning takes place BECAUSE of mistakes, errors, failure, being wrong, and constructive arguments/debate--not in spite of these things. 
        Instead of merely studying a finished work, there is great value in being exposed to the unfinished work leading up to that final draft. For the rough drafts tell a story of their own. It is a story of hard work, determination, patience, resilience, and courage to face one's failures and overcome them as a stronger writer and a stronger human. To me, that is what "the Humanities" are all about.
