# Thoughts about Remote Learning

Once the COVID-19 lockdown was put in place nationwide, I'll be the first to admit that many doubts flooded my mind. While I counted myself lucky that, in general, my English classes were easily transferred to an online platform consisting of readings and online discusssions (compared to some of my STEM friends whose hands-on labs were impacted), I wasn't sure how Digital Literature would work remotely. Sure, I understood that the end goal of this class was to be able to do exactly this--collaborate through primarily digital means; but what about the process of learning to get to that endpoint? How would I teach myself encoding techniques, pushing on Github, and TEI/.xml files? And how on Earth would group projects get completed on time?

To my pleasant surprise, most everything has gone relatively smoothly! (*Whew!*) With such helpful instruction from our professor and assistants, I was able to get caught up and follow along for the most part on different coding lessons. I was even eventually able to get my TEI file validated with the help of one of my friendly group project members. And, while I was afraid we'd get off to a rocky start with the group project due to communication struggles, we've been able to get most everyone working productively and have met all the deadlines. I'm proud and relieved at how well we all work together, allocating different project tasks according to our comfort levels and skills. It amazes me at how much can get done with teamwork and communication--more than I would have ever thought possible! I'm proud and grateful for each and every person's help throughout this course. If anything, it has taught me the power of keeping up optimism and one's faith in humanity during times of crisis, because ultimately it is the worst of times that showcase the best of human potential.
