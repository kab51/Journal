## Things I've Learned During Remote Learning:

Since in-class instruction has switched to remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I've had to do a lot more self-instruction than I ever thought I could have done before coming into this course. 

Anything related to computers, tech, and coding is far from my forte. Having no previous instruction in these matters, I was always curious about what goes into coding. While I know I have only grazed the surface, I am proud of everything that I have learned from this class so far, especially considering the circumstances. Some of these things include:

- Gaining familiarity with TEI files and the language they use
- Commands for revision purposes (add, del, line breaks, etc.)
- Commands for strikethrough, and specifying more exact locations of inserted words in the drafts of *Walden* 
- Familiarity with JSTimeline, the Excel sheet process it uses, and how to publish it to the web for others to see
- I have also gained an appreciation for close reading and metareading, as it relates to discovering insight into *why* authors make the revisions that they do. After all, revisions often reflect a writer's thought process. For example, just because a word was crossed out does not mean it was a typo; it often means a more accurate word was thought up to replace it, which may in turn impact the meaning of the text.
