##Things I Learned Today

- Today, I learned about URI and how to call images
- I also learned how to manipulate the images (e.g., alter the size, rotate, etc.)
- I used what I learned to include the following *Walden* MS image and reduce it to 10% of its original full size:

*P.S. I also learned that Thoreau had **very** elegant handwriting!!*
