## Things I Learned Today

### Markdown

Today, I learned:

- About the relationship between Git Bash and GitHub

About GitHub repositories, and how to make and account

- The difference between ***mkdir*** and ***touch*** ("mkdir" is used for creating directories, or folders; "touch" is used for creating documents)
